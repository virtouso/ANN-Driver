# ANN-Driver

Attention- this research is still under work and has problems.

this is about to make a physically driven car to be controller by an ANN(Artificial Neural Network)

this research uses RCK plugin as car controller and Noedify as machine learning framework. both of these packages are free.

in this research i'm looking for to make ANN learn from player behaviour.

training data is : simpler version of what player sees as a picture in screen as training input and buttons player pressed as output



a simpple look of the player screen is:
